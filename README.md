# steam-machine-learning

# Description

A machine learning project using data about 27,000 Steam games.

I started this project because I wanted to try a binary classification problem with all binarized data.

# A Note about Visualizations

I'm aware that the graphs in the Jupyter notebooks are tiny. I will post full-sized images of them in a separate folder for viewing.
